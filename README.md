Code for finding toxoplasma epitopes common to human brain proteins

# needs to be updated! the infi bellow is just an example

### Workflow overview
TO-DO: Include code flow

===  

- TO-DO: Descrition at large

- This pipeline is meant to reproduce the results in: TO-DO-add url and doi after paper is published

The pipeline takes as INPUT an excel samplesheet created by UGPM, LaNSE, Cinvestav-IPN from a Synapt G2-Si Mass Spectrometer. Contact Emmanuel Castro-Rios (eriosc@cinvestav.mx) for more info. It also takes a .csv samplesheet describing sampleID_replicate and the condition (i.e. control vs treatment). 

'Proteomic compare' is a pipeline tool that takes peptide quantifications in excel format and process it to generate a volcano plot and PCA of comparisons between conditions. This pipeline generates the followin outputs:  
For each INPUT .xlsx
1) a figurte of a volcano plot with UP and DOWN peptides;  
2) a figure same as 1) but with labeled peptides;  
3) a figure of a PCA plot created from the UP and DOWN peptides;
4) a figure of a panel diagnostics for 3), including a screeplot, a Parallel Coordinate Plot, a Biplot, and a labeled PCA with sample names.

### Features
  **-v 0.0.1**

* Supports .xlsx files from  UGPM, LaNSE, Cinvestav-IPN from a Synapt G2-Si Mass Spectrometer
* Results include labelled and unlabelled volcano plot
* Results include PCA and a diagnostics screeplot, PCP, and biplot
* Scalability and reproducibility via a Nextflow-based framework

### TO-DO(s)  
* Easy deploy with docker
* Make docker outputs not root owned

## Requirements
#### Compatible OS*:
* [Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)

#### Incompatible OS*:
* UNKNOWN  

\* Proteomic compare may run in other UNIX based OS and versions, but testing is required.  

#### Command line Software required:
| Requirement | Version  | Required Commands * |
|:---------:|:--------:|:-------------------:|
| [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html) | 22.10.4 | nextflow |
| [R](https://www.r-project.org/) | 4.2.2 | Rscript |

\* These commands must be accessible from your `$PATH` (*i.e.* you should be able to invoke them from your command line).  

#### R packages required:

```
cowplot version: 1.1.1
dplyr version: 1.1.2
factoextra version: 1.0.7
ggplot2 version: 3.4.2
ggrepel version: 0.9.3
ggsci version: 3.0.0
matrixStats version: 1.0.0
openxlsx version: 4.2.5.2
scales version: 1.2.1
stringr version: 1.5.0
tidyr version: 1.3.0
```

---

### Installation
Download pipeline from Github repository:  
```
git@github.com:Iaguilaror/low_BMD_in_PMWMX.git
```

---

## Replicate our analysis (Testing the pipeline):

* Estimated test time:  **5 minute(s)**  

1. To test pipeline execution using test data, run:  
```
./runtest.sh
```

2. Your console should print the Nextflow log for the run, once every process has been submitted, the following message will appear:  
```
======
 Basic pipeline TEST SUCCESSFUL
======
```

3. Pipeline results for test data should be in the following directory:  
```
./paper-results/
```

### Usage
TO-DO

### Pipeline Inputs

* An `.xlsx excel samplesheet` created by UGPM, LaNSE, Cinvestav-IPN from a Synapt G2-Si Mass Spectrometer. Contact Emmanuel Castro-Rios (eriosc@cinvestav.mx) for more info.  

NAMING CONVENTION: filename should be CONDITION1_vs_CONDITION2.xlsx, because the condition names will be taken from the filename.

### Pipeline Results

Inside the directory paper-results/ you can find the following:

* A `.volcano.png figure` with the figure showing a volcano plot.  

* A `.volcano.named.png image` same as above but highlighting top UP and DOWN peptides.  

* A `.UP_and_DOWN_hits.xlsx excel file` that includes only UP and DOWN differentiated peptides according to the thresholds hardcoded in the volcano.R script.  

* A `.PCA_main.png figure` with the figure showing a PCA for two conditions.  

* A `PCA_diagnostic.png image` same as above but showing a panel with: screeplot, labeled PCA, a Parallel Coordinate Plot, and a biplot. Meant to provide an overview of the whole PCA.
